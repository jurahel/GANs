# Gamma-Gan
In this script a GAN approximates a Gamma Distribution. The setup works with multiple shapes of Gamma which can be adapted in the script.
The plot tracks the error of the discriminator as well as the generator, while the GIF summarizes the training procedure. We can see the 
stabilization of the training after approx. 2000 epochs in both the GIF and the error plot.
