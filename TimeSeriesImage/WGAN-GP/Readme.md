In here we use an improved method for training GANs with Wasserstein distance. Instead
of enforcing the Lipschitz constraint by weight clipping we use the gradient penalty method
from the corresponding paper.
We try two methods, a convolutional network and a multilayer perceptron for the task. Both did not
succeed in their task yet and work is still ongoing.
